#_SpinFlowSim_ examples

This folder contains examples that illustrate how to use SpinFlowSim for your diffusion MRI analyses. The examples rely on additional custom-written code, which is included here for convenience. Some third-party packages are also required, as for example:
* [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel) (examples tested with version '5.1.0')
* [numpy](https://numpy.org) (examples tested with version '1.23.5')
* [scipy](https://scipy.org) (examples tested with version '1.10.1')

In this first [tutorial](https://github.com/radiomicsgroup/SpinFlowSim/blob/main/examples/tutorial1.md), we show how to create and initialise a SpinFlowSim _pipenet_ object, in order to resolve an exemplificative vascular network drawn on histology.

In this second [tutorial](https://github.com/radiomicsgroup/SpinFlowSim/blob/main/examples/tutorial2.md), we show how synthetic signals can be used to inform microvasculature inference, replicating the _in silico_ parameter estimation experiments of our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.15.24310335).
