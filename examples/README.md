# _SpinFlowSim_ examples

This folder contains examples that illustrate how to use SpinFlowSim for your diffusion MRI analyses.

In [**tutorial 1**](https://github.com/radiomicsgroup/SpinFlowSim/blob/main/examples/tutorial1.md), we show how to create and initialise a SpinFlowSim _pipenet_ object, in order to resolve an exemplificative vascular network drawn on histology.

In [**tutorial 2**](https://github.com/radiomicsgroup/SpinFlowSim/blob/main/examples/tutorial2.md), we show on _in silico_ data how synthetic signals can be used to inform microvasculature parameter estimation.

Some third-party packages are required to go through the tutorials, namely:
* [numpy](https://numpy.org) (developed with version 1.24.2)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) (developed with version 1.5.3)
