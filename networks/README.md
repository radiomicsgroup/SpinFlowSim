SpinFlowSim is showcased on vascular networks reconstructed from 2D histological images.  

The networks were drawn manually, tracing visible capillaries in 11 stained liver biopsies.

The SpinFlowSim dataset consists of **15 vascular networks**:

The network dataset has been augmented to 1500 realizations by varying input flow [1.5 × 10⁻⁴ ; 5.5 × 10⁻³], as well as inlet/outlet nodes.



Start running SpinFlowSim by choosing from any of the 1500 network realizations stored as `.bin` files.
